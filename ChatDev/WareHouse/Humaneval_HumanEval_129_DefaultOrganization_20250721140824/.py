def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.
    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with your current
    cell. A path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid. A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B 
    (of length k) if lst_A is lexicographically less than lst_B. 
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path goes through.
