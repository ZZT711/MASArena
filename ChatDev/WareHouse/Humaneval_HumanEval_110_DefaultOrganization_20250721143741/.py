def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """
    This function takes two lists of numbers and determines whether it is possible
    to perform an exchange of elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of
    lst1 even, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".
    Parameters:
    lst1 (list): The first list of numbers.
    lst2 (list): The second list of numbers.
    Returns:
    str: "YES" if lst1 can be made all even, "NO" otherwise.
